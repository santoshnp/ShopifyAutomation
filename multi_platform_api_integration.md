# BizzGuru Multi-Platform API Integration Architecture

## Overview

BizzGuru's core functionality relies on its ability to connect with multiple e-commerce platforms and content management systems. This document outlines the technical architecture for a universal API connector framework that will allow BizzGuru to seamlessly integrate with Shopify, WordPress, WooCommerce, Wix, Squarespace, and other platforms.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Universal API Connector Framework

The foundation of our multi-platform integration is a modular connector framework that abstracts away the differences between various platforms.

#### Core Components:

- **Authentication Manager**
  - OAuth 2.0 implementation for platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce
  - API key management for platforms with key-based authentication
  - Session management and token refresh mechanisms
  - Secure credential storage with encryption

- **Request Handler**
  - Standardized request formatting
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Response parsing and normalization

- **Data Mapper**
  - Schema translation between platforms
  - Field mapping configuration
  - Data type conversion
  - Validation rules

### 2. Platform-Specific Adapters

Each supported platform will have a dedicated adapter that implements the specific requirements for that platform's API.

#### Shopify Adapter
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Collection and category management
- Order processing
- Customer data access
- Theme and content customization
- Webhook management for real-time updates

#### WordPress/WooCommerce Adapter
- WP REST API integration
- WooCommerce API integration
- Product and inventory management
- Content management (posts, pages)
- Media library access
- Plugin and extension compatibility

#### Wix Adapter
- Wix API integration
- Product catalog management
- Content updates
- Design element modifications
- SEO settings management

#### Squarespace Adapter
- Content management
- Product catalog updates
- Inventory synchronization
- Order management
- Design customization within platform constraints

#### Custom Website Adapter
- REST API integration capabilities
- Webhook implementation
- FTP/SFTP file management for static sites
- Database connection options (where applicable)
- Custom script injection

### 3. Content Synchronization Engine

The synchronization engine manages the flow of data between BizzGuru and connected platforms.

#### Features:
- **Bidirectional Sync**
  - Read operations to import existing content
  - Write operations to update content across platforms
  - Conflict detection and resolution

- **Sync Scheduling**
  - Real-time updates via webhooks where supported
  - Scheduled synchronization for periodic updates
  - Manual sync triggers for on-demand updates

- **Version Control**
  - Content versioning and history
  - Rollback capabilities
  - Audit logging of all changes

- **Batch Processing**
  - Efficient handling of bulk operations
  - Progress tracking for large updates
  - Resumable operations in case of interruption

### 4. User Onboarding and Connection Management

A streamlined process for users to connect their existing platforms to BizzGuru.

#### Components:
- **Connection Wizard**
  - Step-by-step guided setup for each platform
  - Visual feedback on connection status
  - Troubleshooting assistance

- **Platform Dashboard**
  - Overview of connected platforms
  - Connection health monitoring
  - Quick actions for each connection

- **Permission Management**
  - Granular control over what BizzGuru can access
  - Transparency about data usage
  - Easy disconnection process

## Implementation Roadmap

## API Security Considerations

- All API credentials encrypted at rest
- HTTPS for all communications
- OAuth for secure delegated access
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with platform-specific security requirements
- Data minimization principles applied

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js backend with Express
- PostgreSQL for metadata and mapping storage
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Webhook receivers for real-time updates
- Background job processing for synchronization tasks

## User Experience Considerations

- Platform connection should take less than 5 minutes
- Clear feedback on connection status
- Transparent error messages with actionable solutions
- Preview capabilities before pushing content changes
- Ability to selectively sync specific content types

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- API health monitoring
- Automatic detection of API changes in connected platforms
- Alerting for failed synchronizations
- Usage metrics for optimization
- Regular adapter updates to maintain compatibility

This architecture ensures that BizzGuru can seamlessly connect to multiple e-commerce and content platforms, allowing users to manage their online presence across various systems with a single, AI-powered interface.
