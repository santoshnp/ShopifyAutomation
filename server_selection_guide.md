## Server Setup Process

Once you've selected a provider, follow these steps to set up your server:

### 1. Create an Account
Sign up with your chosen provider and verify your email address.

### 2. Create a New Server Instance
- Select Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as the operating system
- Choose the plan that meets or exceeds our minimum requirements
- Select a data center region closest to your target audience
- Add an SSH key for secure access (recommended) or use password authentication

### 3. Initial Server Setup
After your server is provisioned, you'll need to:

1. Connect to your server via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh root@your_server_ip
   ```

2. Update the system:
   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. Create a non-root user with sudo privileges:
   ```bash
   adduser yourusername
   usermod -aG sudo yourusername
   ```

4. Set up basic firewall:
   ```bash
   ufw allow OpenSSH
   ufw allow 80
   ufw allow 443
   ufw enable
   ```

### 4. Point Your Domain to the Server
In your domain registrar's DNS settings:

1. Create an A record:
   - Host: @ (or leave blank)
   - Value: Your server's IP address
   - TTL: 3600 (or default)

2. Create a CNAME record for www:
   - Host: www
   - Value: bizzguru.de
   - TTL: 3600 (or default)

### 5. Verify Server Access
Ensure you can:
- SSH into your server
- Access your server via its IP address in a web browser (you'll see a default page or connection error, which is normal at this stage)

## Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a smaller instance and upgrade as needed
2. **Reserved Instances**: Some providers offer discounts for longer commitments
3. **Free Tier**: AWS offers a free tier for the first 12 months
4. **Promotional Credits**: Look for new user promotions from providers
5. **European Providers**: Hetzner and OVH often have more competitive pricing

## Next Steps

Once your server is set up and accessible:
1. Note your server's IP address
2. Ensure you have SSH access credentials
3. Verify your domain is pointing to your server
4. Proceed with the BizzGuru automated setup script
